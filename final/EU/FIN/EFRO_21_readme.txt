Endless ATC Rovaniemi v1.0 by Zac Kaplowitz

AIRAC 2104

---------------------------------------------------------

Runway 21 is used for both departures and arrivals. The platform altitude for 21 is 2400ft - however, when cleared for an arrival, aircraft will descend automatically. Descend all aircraft to 3000ft by NIPAK and allow them to descend further automatically.

Aircraft should generally fly an arrival and not be vectored. Where necessary, aircraft should be vectored for a 10 mile final at 2400ft.

The initial climb for all departures is 5000ft. Since some TMA exit points are also entry points, be extremely cautious giving FL140 initially. It's always safer to give something like FL80 to begin with, and reassess as the situation progresses.

The minimum separation in the TMA is 5nm. Aircraft on the localiser must be separated by 7nm, as per ICAO single runway minima. During periods of high intensity arrivals, reduced minima of 3nm may be used. Departures via the same exit point must be separated by 12nm on TMA exit.

All arrivals from the south should be issued descent to be level at 6000ft abeam the airport. This will allow for continous descent. Passing around 7000ft, if no traffic is conflicting, they should be given descent to 3000ft and allowed to establish on the approach without further input.

Arrivals from ROTKO must be given immediate continous descent or they will be too high for the approach. If an immediate continous descent isn't possible, expedite must be used. They can either be given 3000ft straight away, or 6000ft and then 3000ft, the same as arrivals from the south.

Departures should simply be climbed to ensure separation from arrivals and other departures.
