Endless ATC Heathrow v1.0 by Zac Kaplowitz

AIRAC 2104

This file does not simulate departures, as Heathrow Director almost never speaks to departures.

---------------------------------------------------------

Runway 27L and 27R are both used for arrivals - generally not together. Dual approaches are rarely used during high arrival:departure ratio periods, generally early morning arrivals from America. Dual approaches can be activated by setting the skill to 18 or above.

There are no STARs covered by Heathrow Director - aircraft are handed off descending to FL90 inbound BIG, BNN, LAM or OCK. Vectors are generally given from these points (aircraft leave the VOR on a specified heading) but can be given earlier, such as on initial contact.

The minimum separation is 3nm. Aircraft on the localiser must be separated by at least 2.5nm.

Skill 8, cap 12
Flow 35, cap 45

Fun traffic config:
Skill 12, cap 16
Flow 55, cap 75
